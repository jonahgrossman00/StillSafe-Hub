# StillSafe

StillSafe is a groundbreaking web application designed to predict the risk of stillbirth and empower families and healthcare providers with actionable insights. Built by a team of UC Berkeley Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) students, StillSafe leverages advanced machine learning to provide early detection and personalized recommendations, fostering hope, action, and equity in maternal healthcare.

## Features

- **Risk Assessment Tool**: Users can input pregnancy-related information (e.g., age, BMI, medical history) to receive a personalized pregnancy risk assessment.
- **Tips For Success**: Offers medically-approved tips and information based on the user's risk level to support a safer pregnancy journey.
- **Feedback Section**: Enables users to share their thoughts and suggestions directly through the platform to help improve its functionality.

## Why We Care

Each year, 2 million stillbirths occur globally, with 1 in every 175 babies stillborn in the United States alone. Many of these tragedies happen unexpectedly in seemingly healthy pregnancies, leaving families overwhelmed by grief and financial burdens. Research shows that 80% of stillbirths are preventable with early detection, timely interventions, and equitable access to healthcare. StillSafe aims to bridge the gap in early detection and empower families with the knowledge and tools they need to act.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-End**: Streamlit for building the interactive web interface.
- **Back-End**: AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3 for secure and scalable storage of datasets and models.
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced models trained using CDC datasets of birth and fetal death records to identify key risk factors.
